	abstract = {The establishment of a digital healthcare system is a national and community task. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany is providing funding for consortia consisting of university hospitals among others participating in the "Medical Informatics Initiative". Exchange of medical data between research institutions necessitates a place where meta information for this data is made accessible. Within these consortia different metadata registry solutions were chosen. To promote interoperability between these solutions, we have examined whether the portal of Medical Data Models is eligible for managing and communicating metadata and relevant information across different data integration centres of the Medical Informatics Initiative and beyond. Apart from the MDM-portal, some ISO 11179-based systems such as Samply.MDR as well as openEHR-based solutions are going to be applyed. In this paper, we have focused on the creation of a mapping model between the CDISC ODM standard and the Samply.MDR import format. In summary, it can be stated that the mapping model is feasible and promote the exchangeability between different metadata registry approaches.},
